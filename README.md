# My "dotfile(s)"

I bounce around from editor to editor but I always end up back at neovim. 
But honestly, I find the maintenance of neovim config too bothersome. 
I always end up thinking I need this and I need that and that I need to create some 
specizlied keybindings for a specialized workflow and I got to try a new plugin, etc, etc, etc.

So instead I'm now of the opinion that I need to drastically reduce the annoyance of 
"config hell" and look for something simple & opiniated. There are others like
nvchad or lunar-vim, but they seem far too extensive. kickstart neovim seemed really
nice to me, and simplified, and I like it. 

Here are a few things I've come to learn about myself:
- don't care about file explorers. netrw and vim-vinegar are perfect
- I love vim-fugitive and almost feel that its the deciding feature over any other editor
- I love themes. Specifically, I like to change themes often but not make them myself (checkout the lame
failure of "vimdate" theme)
- I don't care about keybindings (as much).
- neovim needs to look pretty so I'm always switching themes and fonts. Oh did I just say that?
- vim-surround is perfect and I keep thinking it's part of neovim and not a plugin

## Only Neovim?
While I've used tmux before I don't really see the benefit. iTerm does everything I need,
and no config. Sometimes I'll change the colorscheme. 

I use oh-my-zsh but I don't care about that config either. I just want it to look a bit different
sometimes, so occasionally I'll change the theme.
